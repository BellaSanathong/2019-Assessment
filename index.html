                <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
                <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
                <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
                <h4>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</h4>
                <p>The alt attribute only displays when the content - such as a video, image, vector graphic, etc. - does not load properly. If the content doesn't load accordingly then whatever is in the alt attribute will display in place. Whereas the title attribute is displayed when the corresponding object is hovered by the mouse.</p>
                <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Athenaeum</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A library or reading room</dd>
                    <dd>An institution for the promotion of literary or scientific learning</dd>
                    <dd>(Initial capital letter) A sanctuary of Athena at Athens, built by the Roman emperor Hadrian, and frequented by poets and scholars</dd>
